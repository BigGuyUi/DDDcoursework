1. Additional Stakeholders
You mention that others may be identified through analysis. Here are a few worth considering:

Student Support Services – May need access to student wellbeing data to offer proactive help.
Admin Staff – Could manage scheduling, notifications, or system maintenance.
IT Services – Responsible for technical support and system upkeep.
Mental Health Advisors / Counsellors – Might benefit from anonymized or consented data to identify students in need.

2. Expanded Usage Scenarios
To make the app more useful and future-proof, consider adding:

Notifications & Reminders:

Students receive reminders to submit wellbeing check-ins.
PS and ST get alerts for overdue check-ins or missed meetings.


Meeting History & Notes:

PS can log notes from meetings.
Students can view summaries or action points.


Escalation Workflow:

If a student reports poor wellbeing repeatedly, the system flags it to ST or support services.


Data Visualization:

PS and ST can view trends in student wellbeing over time.


Privacy & Consent Management:

Students can control who sees their wellbeing data.
Clear policies on data usage and storage.



3. Technical Considerations
You might want to include:

Authentication & Role-Based Access – Ensures users only see what they’re allowed to.
Mobile & Web Accessibility – Should work across devices.
Integration with University Systems – For calendars, student records, etc.

4. User Experience Goals

Easy to use and intuitive interface.
Support for accessibility (e.g., screen readers, high contrast mode).
Multilingual support if needed.
